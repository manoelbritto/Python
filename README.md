# Python

# Project: Bank and Poll

This project extract data from two different CSV files. One is from a Bank, and another is from an election data. With Python code, I can work with these files to create my analysis.

## Getting Started

This instruction will show you what you need to execute the Python code.

Also, there are two folders in this project. The first one is PyBank, and the other one is PyPoll. Both folders have their CSV file inside the Resource folder.

### Prerequisites

You should have installed in your machine Python, but if you don’t have, then you can search for “python anaconda install” and procedure the installation for your system operation.

You can open your command prompt and type:
> **python –version**

If a version shows up (e.g., Python 3.7.2), then you already have Python installed in your machine.

## Development Requirement

PyBank has a code that shows:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll has a code that shows:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Deployment

**PyBank:**

Open this path Code/PyBank

Execute the main.py as it in you command prompt:
> **python main.py**

It will show this result on your command:

**PyPoll:**

Open this path Code/PyPoll

Execute the main.py as it in your command prompt:
> **python main.py**

It will show this result on your command:
